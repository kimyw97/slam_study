  By not providing "Findrobot_monitoring.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "robot_monitoring", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "robot_monitoring"
  with any of the following names:

    robot_monitoringConfig.cmake
    robot_monitoring-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "robot_monitoring" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "robot_monitoring_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "robot_monitoring" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
